Song lyrics:

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl it's really good to see you come around
I know you been lost, I'm glad you got found
'Cause I've been a little lost myself
Found an old picture of you on my phone
Got a new feeling now I won't let go
'Til I can, I can tell you for myself
Why don't you stay for a while?
It's been too long since I've smiled
There's too few people I trust
I won't ask you for too much
Good conversation and such
And if I'm being honest
From time to time
You cross my mind
Good company 
Is hard to find
From time to time
You cross my mind
So stay with me
Just for the night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
